Action Sequence:
Step 1: 
robot1 is now in room2. 
(at ball1 room3) with goal (at ball1 room1)
(at ball2 room2) with goal (at ball2 room2)
(at ball3 room4) with goal (at ball3 room3)
ball1 is unsatisfied, ball2 is satisfied, ball3 is unsatisfied.
All balls that are in the same room with robot1 are satisfied.
Go to complete next unsatisfied ball (from first to last): ball1 
(move robot1 room2 room3)
(pick ball1 room3)
(move robot1 room3 room1)
(drop ball1 room1)
Step 2:
robot1 is now in room1. 
(at ball1 room1) with goal (at ball1 room1)
(at ball2 room2) with goal (at ball2 room2)
(at ball3 room4) with goal (at ball3 room3)
ball1 is satisfied, ball2 is satisfied, ball3 is unsatisfied.
All balls that are in the same room with robot1 are satisfied.
Go to complete next unsatisfied ball (from first to last): ball3 
(move robot1 room1 room4)
(pick ball3 room4)
(move robot1 room4 room3)
(drop ball3 room3)
Step 3:
robot1 is now in room3.
(at ball1 room1) with goal (at ball1 room1)
(at ball2 room2) with goal (at ball2 room2)
(at ball3 room3) with goal (at ball3 room3)
ball1 is satisfied, ball2 is satisfied, ball3 is satisfied.
All balls are satisfied.
