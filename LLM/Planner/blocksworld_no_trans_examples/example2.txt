I have 5 blocks. Initially: Block b1 is on the table. Block b2 is on the table. Block b3 is on top of b2. Block b4 is on the table. Block b5 is on top of b4. Your goal is to move the blocks such that they are stacked in the order: b3 on b1, b1 on b4, b4 on b2, b2 on b5, and b5 on table. 

Action Sequence:
We need to build the blocks from bottom to top.
Fifth goal: b5 on table
(unstack b5 b4)
(putdown b5)
Fourth goal: b2 on b5
(unstack b3 b2)
(putdown b3)
(pickup b2)
(stack b2 b5)
Third goal: b4 on b2
(pickup b4)
(stack b4 b2)
Second goal: b1 on b4
(pickup b1)
(stack b1 b4)
First goal: b3 on b1
(pickup b3)
(stack b3 b1)
