I have 5 balls within 4 rooms. Initially: Robot is in room2. Ball ball1 is in room1. Ball ball2 is in room2. Ball ball3 is in room4. Ball ball4 is in room3. Ball ball5 is in room4. Your goal is to move the balls to specific rooms: ball1 in room1, ball2 in room1, ball3 in room4, ball4 in room2, and ball5 in room1.
